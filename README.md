# Super Metroid: Redesign Randomizer EmoTracker
EmoTracker pack for Super Metroid Redesign: Randomizers

Currently there is no official Redesign Randomizer, but if you go to the discord linked at https://www.twitch.tv/azder , azder will be able to create them for you.

Get EmoTracker here: https://emotracker.net/

Thanks additionally to SauceRelic for their Super Metroid Randomizer Tracker: https://github.com/SauceRelic/SauceRelic.github.io

You'll probably want this on a full monitor because Super Metroid: Redesign's maps is massive!
