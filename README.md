# Super Metroid: Redesign Randomizer EmoTracker
EmoTracker pack for Super Metroid Redesign: Randomizers

Super Metroid Redesign Randomizer: https://github.com/Komarulon/smrandomizer

Get EmoTracker here: https://emotracker.net/

Thanks additionally to SauceRelic for their Super Metroid Randomizer Tracker: https://github.com/SauceRelic/SauceRelic.github.io

You'll probably want this on a full monitor because Super Metroid: Redesign's maps is massive!

I recommend pressing F11 (the "Toggle all locations visible" hotkey) in emotracker. This will cause items to remain a grey square on the map after selecting them. 

## Installation

Get it on emotracker! No crazy install!

But if you want to do the crazy install:

Get the latest release on the releases page: https://github.com/Komarulon/SuperMetroidRedesignRandomizerEmoTracker/releases

Download the zip file, and extract it into:
C:\Users\[Your Username]\Documents\EmoTracker\packs
so you'll have a folder:
C:\Users\[Your Username]\Documents\EmoTracker\packs\smredesignrando

Open EmoTracker. In the top right, select the gear. In the menu, this tracker will be listed under Other. 

## Issues/Updates

Feel free to make a github issue if there's an issue with the map, the map is from https://www.metroid-database.com/old_site/sm/hacks/redesign_map.png but has been updated, as there is at least one error in that map.
