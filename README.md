# Super Metroid: Redesign Randomizer EmoTracker
EmoTracker pack for Super Metroid Redesign: Randomizers

Currently there is no official Redesign Randomizer, but if you go to the discord linked at https://www.twitch.tv/azder , azder will be able to create them for you.

Get EmoTracker here: https://emotracker.net/

Thanks additionally to SauceRelic for their Super Metroid Randomizer Tracker: https://github.com/SauceRelic/SauceRelic.github.io

You'll probably want this on a full monitor because Super Metroid: Redesign's maps is massive!

I recommend pressing F11 (the "Toggle all locations visible" hotkey) in emotracker. This will cause items to remain a grey square on the map after selecting them. 

## Installation

Get the latest release on the releases page: https://github.com/Komarulon/SuperMetroidRedesignRandomizerEmoTracker/releases

Download the zip file, and extract it into:
C:\Users\[Your Username]\Documents\EmoTracker\packs
so you'll have a folder:
C:\Users\[Your Username]\Documents\EmoTracker\packs\smredesignrando

Open EmoTracker. In the top right, select the gear. In the menu, this tracker will be listed under Other.
